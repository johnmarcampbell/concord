# Concord — domain glossary

The vocabulary the project's code, docs, and conversations must agree on.
Implementation lives elsewhere; this file is a dictionary, not a spec.

## Source domain (Congressional Record)

The vocabulary in this section covers the Congressional Record sub-domain — the original scope of the project. The broader Congress sub-domain (Members, Bills, Votes, …) is defined under "Entities" below.


- **Congressional Record** — the official record of the proceedings and debates of the U.S. Congress, published daily that Congress is in session. Data source.
- **Issue** — one day's edition of the Congressional Record. Identified by `(volume, issue_number)`. Carries metadata: `issue_date`, `congress`, `session`.
- **Section** — a top-level grouping within an issue: `Senate Section`, `House Section`, `Extensions of Remarks Section`, `Daily Digest`.
- **Article** — one discrete item within a section. Has `title`, `start_page`, `end_page`, a Formatted Text URL and a PDF URL on congress.gov.
- **Granule ID** — the stable identifier for an article, e.g. `CREC-2026-05-22-pt1-PgD551-6`. Embedded in both the text and PDF URLs. Used as the primary key across the entire pipeline; dedup is keyed on it.
- **Proceeding** — the canonical output record of the scrape pipeline. One article's metadata + plain text + fetch timestamp. The unit of analysis throughout the project.

## Entities (broader Congress sub-domain)

- **Member** — a person who has served in the U.S. Congress. The canonical actor entity. Identified by Bioguide ID. "Former" vs "current" is a query filter, not a separate term.
- **Bioguide ID** — the stable primary key for a Member, assigned by the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress. Example: `O000172`. Never reused, never rewritten.
- **Term** — one continuous service period for a Member in one chamber. A Member has 1..N terms. Keyed by `(bioguide_id, congress, chamber)`. Carries party, state, district (House only), and start/end dates.
- **Chamber** — `house` or `senate`. A property of the Term, not the Member: Members can move between chambers across terms.
- **Party** — recorded per-Term, not per-Member. Members can change parties between terms; per-Term storage preserves historical state.
- **Bill** — a piece of legislation introduced in either chamber. Identified by the tuple `(congress, bill_type, bill_number)`; Concord's internal `bill_id` flattens that to `"<congress>-<type>-<number>"` (e.g. `"119-hr-1234"`). In code, "Bill" is conceptual — the aggregate that spans all six endpoints listed under [ADR 0009](docs/adr/0009-multi-endpoint-entities-split-jsonl.md). The wire-shape model for the identity endpoint is `BillDetail`; see [ADR 0018](docs/adr/0018-pydantic-at-the-load-boundary.md).
- **Bill type** — one of eight codes: `hr`, `hres`, `hjres`, `hconres`, `s`, `sres`, `sjres`, `sconres`. Canonical form is lowercase; the API returns uppercase and Concord canonicalizes on ingest.
- **Sponsor** — the single Member who introduced a Bill. 1:1 with Bill (modeled as a column on the `bills` row, not a separate table).
- **Cosponsor** — a Member who formally added their name to an existing Bill after introduction. M:N with Bill via `bill_cosponsors`; carries `sponsorship_date` and a nullable `sponsorship_withdrawn_date`. The wire-shape model is `BillCosponsor` per the endpoint-naming rule in [ADR 0018](docs/adr/0018-pydantic-at-the-load-boundary.md); the bare "Cosponsor" stays as the domain term in prose.
- **Bill action** — one event in a Bill's legislative history (e.g. "Referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations", "Passed House"). Many per Bill; stored verbatim and dimmed at display for routine procedural noise.
- **Policy area** — a single CRS-assigned top-level subject for a Bill (e.g. "Health", "Armed Forces and National Security"). Distinct from the multi-valued **legislative subjects** that live in `bill_subjects`.
- **Vote** — one recorded roll-call decision in a chamber. Identified by the tuple `(chamber, congress, session, roll_number)`; Concord's internal `vote_id` flattens that to `"{chamber}-{congress}-{session}-{roll}"` (e.g. `"house-119-1-240"`). May be on a Bill, on an Amendment to a Bill, or procedural (Speaker election, motion to adjourn, journal approval).
- **Roll-call number** — the chamber's per-session sequential identifier for a recorded vote. Resets to 1 at the start of each `(congress, session)` slot. Combined with chamber/congress/session it forms the Vote's natural key.
- **Session** — the half-Congress that a Vote (or other dated event) falls in. A Congress has two sessions, numbered `1` and `2`; in practice session 1 covers an odd calendar year and session 2 covers the following even year.
- **Vote question** — the free-text description of what was being decided on a roll call (e.g. "On Passage of the Bill", "On Agreeing to the Amendment", "Election of the Speaker"). Always populated; the source of truth for procedural votes that have no Bill or Amendment subject.
- **Vote position** — one Member's recorded choice on one Vote. For standard votes the value is `"Yea"` / `"Nay"` / `"Present"` / `"Not Voting"`; for election votes (e.g. Speaker) it's a candidate's surname. Stored in `vote_positions` keyed by `(vote_id, bioguide_id)`, with `vote_party` denormalized from the API payload.
- **Party Unity Score** — per-Member, per-Congress, per-chamber: the share of *party-unity votes* (votes where a majority of one party opposed a majority of the other) on which the Member voted with their party's majority. Modeled on the CQ Almanac's methodology. Scored independently per chamber so Senate and House majorities aren't pooled. See [ADR 0011](docs/adr/0011-party-unity-score-methodology.md) and `/about/methodology#party-unity` for the precise definition.
- **LIS member ID** — Senate-internal stable identifier for a senator, used in senate.gov LIS (Legislative Information System) XML feeds. Format `"S\d+"` (e.g. `"S428"`). Concord does not store LIS IDs in SQLite; they are used only as a transient join key inside the Senate vote loader, where the LIS-keyed XML position rows are bridged to Bioguide IDs via the senators_cfm.xml roster.
- **`member_full`** — Senate display string in the form `"Surname (Party-State)"` (e.g. `"Alsobrooks (D-MD)"`). Appears in both senate.gov vote-detail XML and `senators_cfm.xml`. Concord uses it as the bridge string for LIS↔Bioguide resolution at vote-load time; the Senate detail XML keys positions by `lis_member_id` rather than Bioguide ID, so the bridge is required to land Senate `vote_positions` rows on the same `bioguide_id` PK as the House.

## Pipeline stages

- **Stage 0 — Scrape**: produces the canonical raw store from the live API. (See ADR 0002.)
- **Stage 1 — Load**: turns the canonical raw store into a database mirror — metadata and full text only, no derived indexes.
- **Stage 2 — Index**: builds the derived indexes (chunks + FTS5 + vector embeddings) from the database mirror. Regenerable. (See ADR 0005.)
- **Stage 3 — Enrich** *(future)*: extracts entities (people, bills, ...) and writes them to entity / mention tables.

## Search vocabulary

- **Keyword search** — lexical search against the FTS5 index. BM25 ranking, phrase queries, NEAR, snippets.
- **Semantic search** — vector similarity search against chunk embeddings.
- **Hybrid search** — combined ranking that mixes keyword and semantic scores in a single query.
- **RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion)** — the strategy Concord uses to combine FTS5 and vector results into a single ranking. Operates on ranks rather than raw scores.
- **Chunk** — a span of a Proceeding's text sized for one embedding. Chunks are Concord's *unit of retrieval*: both keyword and semantic indexes operate on chunks, and results roll up to Proceedings for display. (See ADR 0005.)

## Components

- **Scraper** — Python. Stage 0. Writes JSONL.
- **Pipeline** — Python. Stages 1, 2, (3). Reads JSONL, writes SQLite.
- **Web** — Python (FastAPI + Jinja2 + HTMX), Tailwind for styling. Reads SQLite, serves the public demo. Single process, same repo. See ADR 0001.

## Models

The shapes data takes in code as it crosses pipeline boundaries. See [ADR 0018](docs/adr/0018-pydantic-at-the-load-boundary.md) for the rules these terms underpin.

- **Wire-shape model** — a Pydantic model whose structure mirrors a single response from a source the project does not control: one Congress API endpoint, one senate.gov XML document, etc. Field names, optionality, and nesting follow the upstream contract verbatim, modulo two cosmetic adaptations (camelCase→snake_case via `alias_generator`, Pydantic's built-in JSON-native type parsing). Custom `@field_validator` semantic shims do not belong on a wire-shape model. The only sanctioned constructor is `@classmethod from_congress_api(payload) -> Self` (or `from_<source>` for non-Congress sources). Wire-shape models are named after the endpoint that produced them (`BillDetail`, `Cosponsor`, `ParsedVoteDetail`). *Project vocabulary; the compound is built from the industry-standard "wire format" but is specific to this codebase.*
- **Domain model** — the Pydantic model the rest of the codebase operates on after any normalization. When the wire shape already aligns with what the application wants, the wire-shape model *is* the domain model — one class plays both roles. This is the common case (`BillDetail`, `Member`, House `Vote`). When the wire shape is awkward, a separate domain model is defined and the wire-shape model is projected into it via a plain function. The Senate vote path is the worked example: `ParsedVoteDetail` (XML wire shape) → `Vote` (domain model).
- **Snapshot envelope** — the on-disk JSONL persistence shape for a mutable entity: `{fetched_at, key, payload}`. Represented in code as `Snapshot[T]`, a Pydantic generic parameterized by the wire-shape model carried in `payload`. `fetched_at` is the capture timestamp; `key` is the natural-key composite used for dedup and upsert; `payload` is wire-shape data (or a sub-section for multi-endpoint entities per [ADR 0009](docs/adr/0009-multi-endpoint-entities-split-jsonl.md)). Proceedings predate the envelope and persist flat per [ADR 0002](docs/adr/0002-jsonl-as-canonical-raw-store.md). The word *envelope* describes the shape; the class is `Snapshot[T]`.

## Storage

- **Canonical raw store** — `proceedings.jsonl`. One Proceeding per line. Append-only. Generated by the scraper. Source of truth.
- **Derived store** — `proceedings.db` (SQLite). Indexed, queryable, rebuildable from the canonical store. Holds proceedings + FTS5 + vec + (future: entities + mentions).
